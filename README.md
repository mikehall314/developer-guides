## A Short Note On Language

This documentation strives to avoid the word "user" in the sense of "end-user".
It is unfortunately common in our profession treat the people who use our
products with disdain. We look down on then, or dismiss them as stupid and lazy.
When our software fails to meet their needs, we argue it is _their fault_ for
having the wrong needs, the wrong device, or simply being incapable.

**This is not a healthy thing for us to do.** These people are not simply users
of our product, they are our _customers_. Our success is directly driven by
meeting the needs of our customers. We don't do this if we lack empathy or any
meaningful understanding of what our customers want. We do this by aligning our
goals with theirs.
